Solve a mystery with a data visualization
========================================

In this assignment you and a partner will write a computer program to help solve a crime. The police have possession of a smartphone and they have asked you to determine if the data from the phone supports the suspects’ claim of innocence. Investigators were able to gather time stamped gps coordinates from the suspects phone in the format (latitude, longitude, 24 hr time): e.g. (37.747201,-122.503728,"13:00").
 
The suspect, Aces Peck, has been accused of breaking and entering. An alarm sounded at the storage unit for the senior facility run by CFI Care Inc. at 2043 19th Avenue 3:15pm on Sunday January 1st 2017. Witnesses saw a male matching Aces’ description leaving the senior facility on foot shortly after the time of the break in. Aces lives near the corner of 45th Ave and Quintara. He claims that he only left his house at 1:30 pm to walk to the Safeway at 730 Taraval St. He says he bought a quart of milk and walked back home. He says he was at home at the time of the break in. Investigators have given you the following data from his phone:
```(37.747201,-122.503728,"13:00")   
(37.747201,-122.503728,"13:10")   
(37.747201,-122.503728,"13:20")   
(37.747201,-122.503728,"13:30")   
(37.7457331,-122.5001465,"13:40")   
(37.7459013,-122.4954998,"13:50")   
(37.7429473,-122.4875535,"14:00")   
(37.7430309,-122.4767629,"14:10")   
(37.7434253,-122.474164,"14:20")   
(37.7434253,-122.474164,"14:30")   
(37.7434253,-122.474164,"14:40")   
(37.7448167,-122.4756721,"14:50")   
(37.7469956,-122.475964,"15:00")   
(37.7496281,-122.4764707,"15:10")   
(37.7486281,-122.4760707,"15:20")   
(37.7482044,-122.4858554,"15:30")   
(37.7456825,-122.4985913,"15:40")   
(37.747201,-122.503728,"15:50")   
(37.747201,-122.503728,"16:00")```   

 
If you think you know the answer to the mystery, call over your instructor and explain your solution.
